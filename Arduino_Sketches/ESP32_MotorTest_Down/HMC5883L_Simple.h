/* NOTE:
 * There are both 7- and 8-bit versions of I2C addresses.
 * 7 bits identify the device, and the eighth bit determines
 * if it's being written to or read from. The Wire library uses
 * 7 bit addresses throughout. If you have a datasheet or sample code 
 * that uses 8 bit address, you'll want to drop the low bit
 * (i.e. shift the value one bit to the right), yielding an 
 * address between 0 and 127.
 * 
 * The HMC datasheet says...
 * " The default (factory) HMC5883L 7-bit slave address is 0x3C for write operations, or 0x3D for read operations. "
 * which is of course silly, what they mean is that these are 8=bit addresses and thus we want to shift right 
 * one of them to get the 7-bit address that Wire wants
 * 
 * 0x3C = 111100
 * >> 1 = 11110
 *      = 0x1E
 * 
 * 0x3D = 111101
 * >> 1 = 11110
 *      = 0x1E
 *

  // Specify the option as COMPASS_SCALE_xxx
  // Lower values are more sensitive, higher values are less sensitive.
  // The default is probably just fine, it works for me.  If it seems very noisy
  // (jumping around), incrase the scale to a higher one.

  // needle you can imagine the digital compass does too.
  //
  // To allow you to mount the compass in different ways you can specify the orientation:
  //   COMPASS_HORIZONTAL_X_NORTH (default), the compass is oriented horizontally, top-side up. when pointing North the X silkscreen arrow will point North
  //   COMPASS_HORIZONTAL_Y_NORTH, top-side up, Y is the needle,when pointing North the Y silkscreen arrow will point North
  //   COMPASS_VERTICAL_X_EAST,    vertically mounted (tall) looking at the top side, when facing North the X silkscreen arrow will point East
  //   COMPASS_VERTICAL_Y_WEST,    vertically mounted (wide) looking at the top side, when facing North the Y silkscreen arrow will point West
